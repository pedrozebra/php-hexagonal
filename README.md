# PHP Hexagonal

This is my first approach to Hexagonal Architecture in frameworkless PHP.

Also known as "Ports and Adapters" Architecture.

This is a personal case of study, to improve my skills on OOP and software design.

The result is a mix of reading some articles and parts of books, watching videos and many headache.

Principally, is based on this kata http://matteo.vaccari.name/blog/archives/154.html
